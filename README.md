# 🚀 GC AI-Powered Project Management System

An integrated project management ecosystem combining Notion, Discord, GitHub, and AI automation for streamlined business operations.

## 📋 Overview

This repository documents the AI-powered project management system designed for the GC work group, enabling seamless integration between Notion task management, Discord communication, and automated workflows using Claude MCP.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Core Components
- **Notion Hub**: Central project and task management
- **Discord Integration**: Real-time communication and notifications
- **AI Automation**: Claude/ChatGPT integration for task completion
- **Cross-Platform Workflows**: GitHub + Google Drive integration

## 🔄 Project Structure

### Revenue Streams
Our projects are organized by **System / Work Type** with client tags:

- **NetSuite / Implementation** (Client: Bryant Park)
- **NetSuite / Advisory** (Client: Olaplex)
- **P21 / Ad Hoc** (Client: Andrew)
- **NetSuite / Retainer** (Client: CandyCo)
- **GCE / AI Development** (Internal)

## 💼 Workflow Process

### 5-Stage Lifecycle
1. **Task Assignment** - Peter creates tasks with requirements in Notion
2. **AI-Assisted Work** - Team uses AI tools for completion
3. **Auto-Documentation** - Progress tracked automatically
4. **Smart Archival** - Content routed to appropriate storage:
   - Code tasks → GitHub
   - Documents → Google Drive
   - Meeting notes → Discord Archive
5. **Team Sync** - Automated notifications and reports
